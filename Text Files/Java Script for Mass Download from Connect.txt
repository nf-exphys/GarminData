#Then use 7-zip to unzip all files to a common location
#Unfortunately, this makes a bunch of folders with one fit file in each
#This will extract the files out of the folders: 
	#Just go to the top-level source folder (whose contents you want to copy), 
	#and in the Windows Explorer search box type * (just a star or asterisk). 
	#This will display every file and sub-folder under the source folder. 
	#Now just sort by Type to group all files together, select them all, 
	#then cut/copy and paste in the destination dir.
